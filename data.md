## Welcome to My Blog!

*January 15, 2026*

Hi! I'm starting this blog to document my journey learning GitHub Pages. This is my very first HTML file, and I'm excited to share what I learn along the way.

**What is GitHub Pages?** It's a free service from GitHub that lets you host websites directly from a GitHub repository. It's completely free and you don't need to manage any servers!

### Why I'm Doing This

I wanted to learn web development using Claude Code and GitHub Pages seemed like the perfect place to start because:

- It's free (no hosting costs)
- It's simple to get started
- I can learn HTML, CSS, and Git at the same time
- My projects are automatically backed up on GitHub

## Setting Up My First Repository

Today I created my first GitHub repository and published this blog. Here's exactly what I did:

### Step 1: Sign in to GitHub Account

I went to [github.com](https://github.com) and signed in.

### Step 2: Created My Repository

I clicked the "+" button, selected "New repository", and named it correctly. I also made sure it was set to "Public" because that's required for free hosting.

### Step 3: Created index.html

This is the file you're reading right now! I created it directly on GitHub by clicking "Add file" and then "Create new file". I named it "index.html" and added my HTML code.

### Step 4: Enabled GitHub Pages

I went to Settings, then clicked on "Pages" in the sidebar. Under "Source", I selected the "main" branch and clicked Save. Within a few minutes, my site was live!

### What I Learned

The most important thing I learned is that GitHub Pages only works with static files - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No server-side code.

- Creating a separate CSS file
- Choosing colors and fonts
- Making the blog mobile-friendly
- Adding images
